# My portfolio as a Test Automation Engineer

## Overview

Hi there! Thank you for stopping by my profile and code repository. My name is Damian, and I work as a Junior QA/Test Engineer. My main interest lies in test automation, which prompted me to create my own repository for developing projects. This serves as a portfolio for potential recruiters and companies, showcasing my current knowledge and approach to test automation. The second objective of this repository is to facilitate continuous learning and skill development. With that in mind, I welcome any form of feedback. Last but not least, perhaps someone can benefit from my insights as well? :)

# Disclaimer

The inclusion of the .env file in this repository serves a specific purpose: to showcase my strategy for managing sensitive data and to ensure that anyone who downloads this repository can seamlessly execute all tests. It's important to note that in actual production scenarios, I would never include this file, as doing so would pose significant security risks.
